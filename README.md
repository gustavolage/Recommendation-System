# Recommendation-System
Objective: to learn more about the theories of recommendation algorithms and how to practice them.

I already knew that the recommender system is a very important field in machine learning, but I had never had direct practical contact with it. So, after coming across a problem and starting to think about how to solve it, I came up with the idea of using a recommender system approach and, in order to learn more about it, I decided to develop this project.
